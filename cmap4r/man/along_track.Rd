\title{Colocalize along a cruise track.  Takes a cruise name and colocalizes
  the cruise track with the specified variable(s). THIS IS THE MAIN
  COLOCALIZATION function for a cruise.}
\usage{
along_track(
  cruise,
  targetTables,
  targetVars,
  depth1,
  depth2,
  temporalTolerance,
  latTolerance,
  lonTolerance,
  depthTolerance
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cruise}{String of the name of cruise. You can see the list of cruises
using \code{cruises()}.}

\item{targetTables}{table names of the target data sets to be matched with
the source data.}

\item{targetVars}{variable names to be matched with the source variable.}

\item{depth1}{LOWER limit for depth along the cruise track (lat/lon
trajectory) the user is interested in.}

\item{depth2}{UPPER limit for depth along the cruise track (lat/lon
trajectory) the user is interested in.}

\item{temporalTolerance}{numeric vector of temporal tolerance values between
pairs of source and target datasets. The size and order of values in this
list should match those of targetTables. If only a single integer value is
given, that would be applied to all target datasets. This parameter is in
day units except when the target variable represents monthly climatology
data in which case it is in month units. Notice fractional values are not
supported in the current version.}

\item{latTolerance}{numeric vector of spatial tolerance values in meridional
direction [deg] between pairs of source and target data sets. If only one
value is given, that would be applied to all target data sets.  A "safe"
value for this parameter can be slightly larger than the half of the target
variable’s spatial resolution.}

\item{lonTolerance}{numeric vector of spatial tolerance values in zonal
direction [deg] between pairs of source and target data sets. If only one
value is given, that would be applied to all target data sets.  A "safe"
value for this parameter can be slightly larger than the half of the target
variable’s spatial resolution.}

\item{depthTolerance}{numeric vector of spatial tolerance values in vertical
direction [m] between pairs of source and target data sets. If only one
value is given, that would be applied to all target data sets.}
}
\value{
A dataset colocalized with the cruise.
